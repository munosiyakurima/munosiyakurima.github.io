            <p>Describing yourself is always a hard task but that's because we think too much about it. Usually the first thing to come to mind is what best describes you. When I am not on the soccer field playing with my friends, you can find me catching a movie at the cinema or indulging myself in some crime or autobiography novels.</p>
            <p>As a Data Enthusiast, you can also find me spending long hours on R studio, Python or SQL trying to clean up data(<i>the hard but interesting part of working with data</i>) and making various calculations on this data. .</p>
            <p>I am a current Computer Science major with an emphasis in Statistics at Carleton College in Northfield, MN. I am also passionate about finiding ways to use technology and data in order to help uplift marginalized communities.</p>

            <p>At the top of years and years of soccer debate is the ultimate question: "WHO IS THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME, RONALDO OR MESSI." I being a huge fan of soccer have definitely had my fair share of participation in this debate. However, as a true soccer fan would realize after years of watching soccer is that both players deserve this status.</p>
			<p>Both have different paths to success and both have stories that inspire anyone in any field. Messi is your natural born talented player, but without commitment to this talent and nurturing of it, this talent would have been wasted. Ronaldo is your hardworking player, a person who puts their al into whatever craft they are pursuing until it produces results.</p>
			<p>So, in conclusion both these players provide inspiration to everyone related to whatever field they are in. IF YOU WANT TO BE THE BEST IN YOUR FIELD, IF YOU HAVE THE TALENT, NURTURE IT AND IF YOU DON'T, PUT THE WORK IN TO ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS!
